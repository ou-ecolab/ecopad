# ecopad
This Repository is intended as an umbrella for the site specific ecopad installation of Yiqi Luo's ecolab.
It contains the different repositories that constitute the ecopad code base as [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). 

# Installation on your computer:
To clone it use 
```bash
       git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ou-ecolab/ecopad.git
 ```
This will check out the subrepositories (in coordinated compatible versions) as subfolders. 
```bash
       cd ecpad/cybercommonds
```
follow the [installations instrtuctions of the cybercommons package:](https://github.com/ou-ecolab/cybercommons) and write down the username and password that you type in since you will later need it to use the api.
